                <h2><strong>Context</strong></h2>
                <p>Animation is defined as a way of making a movie using varying images. Back in the time people would use something as flipbooks to create such animation. Fantasmagorie, created in 1906 was a perfect example of that. The author used papers and pens to make a animation by swapping out papers each frame.</p>
                <p>As the first animation was created, several other people took the dive of the animation world. This such allowed people to create high quality movie animations that will satisfy millions of people to eventually growing into children animaton</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "container container-border">
              <h2><strong>But what if...</strong></h2>
              <p>it didn't have to be this way? Animation using paper could be very tiring. In fact you would have to literally create doezens of pages and what if those pages get lost. Literally part of your animation would be gone and you would be forced to draw it again. Plus if you need to record audio you would have to do it live. </p>
